# Readme



I decided to create a WMD for illustration purposes. This project is meant to be as simple and straightforward as possible. The two goals are, first, to show how easy it is to create a Weapon of Math Destruction. Secondly, to help aspiring data scientist see the process of a project from start to finish. I hope people are inspired to think twice about the ethics of their models.

The outcome of this project is an interactive map in d3.js
